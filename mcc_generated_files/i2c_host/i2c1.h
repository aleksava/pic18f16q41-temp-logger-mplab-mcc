/**
  @Description
    This function writes data to a Client on the bus. The function will attempt
    to write length number of bytes from data buffer to a Client whose address
    is specified by address. The I2C Host will generate a Start condition,
    write the data and then generate a Stop Condition. If the Client NACK the request 
    or a bus error was encountered on the bus, the transfer is terminated. The 
    application can call the I2C1_ErrorGet() function to know that 
    cause of the error.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is then completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.
    Calling the write function when another function is already in progress will
    cause the function to return false.

  @Preconditions
    I2C1_Initialize() must have been called for the associated

  @Param
    address     - 7-bit / 10-bit Client address.
    data        - pointer to source data buffer that contains the data to be
                  transmitted.
    dataLength  - length of data buffer in number of bytes. Also the number of bytes
                  to be written.

  @Returns
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
            initiated.
    false - The request fails,if there was already a transfer in progress when this function
            was called

  @Description
    This function reads the data from a Client on the bus. The function will
    attempt to read length number of bytes into data buffer from a Client whose
    address is specified as address. The I2C Host generate a Start condition,
    read the data and then generate a Stop Condition.
    If the Client NAKs the request or a bus error is encountered on the bus, the
    transfer is terminated. The application can call I2C1_ErrorGet()
    function to know that cause of the error.

/**
  @Description
    This function writes data from the writeData to the bus and then reads data from
    the Client and stores the received in the readData. The function generates a
    Start condition on the bus and will then send writeLength number of bytes
    contained in writeData. The function will then insert a Repeated start condition
    and proceed to read readLength number of bytes from the client. The received
    bytes are stored in readData buffer. A Stop condition is generated after the
    last byte has been received.

    If the Client NAKs the request or a bus error was encountered on the bus, 
    the transfer is terminated. The application can call I2C1_ErrorGet()
    function to know that cause of the error.
